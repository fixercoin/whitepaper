    <h1>Fixercoin Tokenomics</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Tokenomics Overview</h2>
        <p>Tokenomics refers to the economic model of a cryptocurrency or token. It explains how tokens are created, distributed, and used within the ecosystem to encourage certain behaviors and ensure the project's sustainability.</p>

        <h2>2. Key Features of Fixercoin's Tokenomics</h2>

        <h3>20% Burn Reserve in 2025</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What does "burn" mean?</strong> Burning tokens means permanently removing them from circulation, which decreases the total supply.</li>
            <li><strong>Why burn tokens?</strong> Reducing the supply can increase the value of remaining tokens, similar to how scarcity often drives prices up.</li>
            <li class="implication">Implication: In 2025, 20% of Fixercoin's tokens will be burned, making the remaining tokens scarcer and potentially more valuable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5% Allocation for Holder Rewards and Airdrops</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What are holder rewards and airdrops?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Holder rewards</em> are incentives given to people who hold onto their tokensâ€”like earning extra tokens over time.</li>
                    <li><em>Airdrops</em> involve distributing free tokens to community members, often to promote engagement or reward loyalty.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="implication">Implication: 5% of all tokens are set aside to reward loyal users and encourage new community members to get involved.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Strategic Goals of These Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Long-term engagement:</strong> By rewarding holders and planning token burns, Fixercoin aims to motivate people to stay involved over a longer period.</li>
            <li><strong>Community participation:</strong> Incentives like rewards and airdrops encourage more people to join and actively participate in the Fixorium ecosystem.</li>
            <li><strong>Potential boosting of token value:</strong> Scarcity from burning tokens combined with active community rewards can increase demand, which can drive up the token's price.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustained ecosystem growth:</strong> These strategies are designed to help the ecosystem grow steadily over time, making it more robust and valuable.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>In simple terms, Fixercoin's plan is to make its tokens more valuable by removing some from circulation in 2025 (burning) and encouraging users to keep and use their tokens through rewards and free distributions. These measures aim to create a healthy, active community and promote the long-term success of the Fixorium ecosystem.</p>
